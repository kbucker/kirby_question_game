## 💬 What Is This?

This app is a cute and polished way to explore thousands of curated questions that I've collected over the years — the kind you'd use during a friendly get-together, a team icebreaker, or a deep 1-on-1 late at night.

When you load the app, you'll see two buttons:

- 🌞 **Light Question** – These are casual, fun, work-appropriate prompts that get people smiling and talking.
- 🧠 **Heavy Question** – These are deeper, more introspective prompts meant for close friends or groups that feel comfortable being vulnerable together.

Click either button, and you’ll get a randomly selected question of that type. The app also avoids showing repeat questions during the same session.

## 🎯 Why I Made It

I’ve always loved asking good questions — the kind that make people laugh, think, or open up. Over time, I kept a running list in my notes app and spreadsheets. Eventually, I thought:  
**“Why not turn this into a tiny app?”**

So this is it. A little project to bring my favorite questions to life in a way that anyone can use — whether you're at a wedding table, hanging with your team at work, or sitting around a fire with close friends.
